# Bootstrap Multiselect

Bootstrap Multiselect is a JQuery based plugin to provide an intuitive user interface for using select inputs with the multiple attribute present. Instead of a select a bootstrap button will be shown as dropdown menu containing the single options as checkboxes.

Bootstrap 3 port by [Eduard Dudar](https://github.com/edudar).

## Documentation

Documentation, demonstrations and FAQ: [http://davidstutz.github.com/bootstrap-multiselect/](http://davidstutz.github.com/bootstrap-multiselect/).

**Note**: The demo page is based on JQuery 2 - so for IE 6,7 and 8 the plugin will not work properly. Nevertheless, the plugin should run as expected using the .x branch of jQuery.

## Contribute!

Every pull request is appreciated. To make it easier for me to merge fixes and new features have a look at the following guidelines:

* Include documentation for new options and features to avoid undocumented features.
* Add a thorough description to every pull request - so I am able to understand the purpose of the pull request.
* Have a look at the code as to keep the code as comprehensible and coherent as possible (concerning code style, indentation etc. ...).
* Add comments to your code - to help me understand the committed code.
* Add a single pull request per fix or feature you add.
